# OAuthenticator

GitHub OAuth + JuptyerHub Authenticator = OAuthenticator

Example of running [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub)
with [GitHub OAuth](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) for authentication.

## setup

Make a file called `userlist` with one GitHub user name per line.
If that user should be an admin (you!), add `admin` after a space.

For example:

```
mal admin
zoe admin
wash
inara admin
kaylee
jayne
simon
river
```


Create a [GitHub oauth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
Make sure the callback URL is:

    http[s]://[your-host]/hub/oauth_callback

Where `[your-host]` is where your server will be running. Such as `example.com:8000`.

## build

Build the container with:

    docker build -t jupyter/oauthenticator .

### ssl

To run the server on HTTPS, put your ssl key and cert in ssl/ssl.key and ssl/ssl.cert.

## run

Add your oauth client id, client secret, and callback URL to the `env file`.
Once you have built the container, you can run it with:

    docker run -it -p 9000:8000 --env-file=env jupyter/oauthenticator

Which will run the Jupyter server.


# User servers in docker containers

There is [another example](https://github.com/jupyter/dockerspawner/tree/master/examples/oauth)
for using GitHub OAuth to spawn each user's server in a separate docker container.
